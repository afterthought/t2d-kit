# Feature Specification: User Recipe File Management

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-user-can`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The user can create or write user recipe files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: users (actors), create/write (actions), recipe files (data)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to create and edit recipe files so that I can define specifications for diagram generation and documentation workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with access to the system, **When** they create a new recipe file, **Then** the system creates a valid recipe file in the expected format
2. **Given** an existing recipe file, **When** the user modifies its content, **Then** the system saves the changes and validates the updated recipe
3. **Given** a user attempting to create a recipe, **When** they provide invalid content, **Then** the system provides clear error messages about what needs correction
4. **Given** a user with multiple recipe files, **When** they select one to edit, **Then** the system loads the correct file for modification

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user attempts to create a recipe file with a name that already exists?
- How does system handle concurrent edits to the same recipe file?
- What happens when recipe file content exceeds 1MB size limit?
- How does system handle recipe files with invalid YAML syntax or structure?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new recipe files in YAML format with required fields: name, prd (content or file_path), and instructions (diagrams list)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate recipe file content against Pydantic models ensuring type correctness, field constraints, and cross-field validation rules
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to edit existing recipe files maintaining YAML structure integrity
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist recipe files indefinitely unless explicitly deleted by the user
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide feedback when recipe file creation or modification fails with clear validation error messages
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to delete recipe files they have created
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle recipe files up to 1MB in size
- **FR-008**: System MUST support YAML format for recipe files (.yaml or .yml extensions)
- **FR-009**: System MUST store recipe files in user-accessible filesystem locations without access controls
- **FR-010**: Recipe files MUST contain at minimum: name field, prd section (with content or file_path), and instructions section with at least one diagram specification
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate recipe files complete in under 200ms for performance requirements
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both embedded PRD content and file path references in recipe files

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Recipe File**: Represents a user-created YAML specification document containing name, PRD content/reference, diagram instructions, optional content files, and output configuration
- **User**: The actor who creates and modifies recipe files through filesystem operations or MCP tools
