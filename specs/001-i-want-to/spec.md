# Feature Specification: Multi-Framework Diagram Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to implement the system defined in my Multi-Framework Diagram Pipeline - Recipe-Based Architecture Documentation PRD"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A product manager needs to create technical documentation with embedded diagrams from a PRD. They write a YAML recipe file describing the desired diagram types (architecture, sequence, ERD, etc.), provide PRD content as context, and specify output locations. The system automatically selects the best framework for each diagram type (D2 for architecture, Mermaid for Gantt), generates the diagram files, and produces markdown documentation with embedded visuals suitable for GitHub, GitLab, or Confluence publishing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a YAML recipe with diagram specifications and PRD content, **When** they process the recipe through the pipeline, **Then** the system generates framework-specific diagram files and markdown documentation with embedded diagrams
2. **Given** a recipe specifies an architecture diagram without framework selection, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it automatically routes to the optimal framework (D2) based on diagram type
3. **Given** multiple diagram types in a single recipe, **When** processed, **Then** each diagram uses its optimal framework and all outputs are organized in the specified asset folders
4. **Given** a user needs documentation for GitHub, **When** they process their recipe, **Then** the output includes code blocks with proper language tags and collapsible source sections
5. **Given** a diagram type that isn't directly supported, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it falls back to a generic Mermaid rendering with a warning message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when YAML recipe has invalid syntax?
- How does system handle when specified output paths don't exist or lack permissions?
- What happens when a diagram framework CLI tool is unavailable?
- How does system handle extremely large PRD content or complex diagram specifications?
- What happens when multiple recipes are processed simultaneously (batch processing)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load, validate, and parse YAML recipe files containing diagram definitions, PRD content, and output paths
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically select optimal diagram framework based on diagram type using predefined mappings
- **FR-003**: System MUST convert user instructions and PRD content into framework-specific diagram specifications
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate valid diagram definition files (.d2, .mmd, .puml) according to framework requirements
- **FR-005**: System MUST produce markdown documentation with embedded diagrams in multiple formats (inline SVG, code blocks, image references)
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize all generated assets into user-specified folder structures with proper linking
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide fallback rendering for unsupported diagram types with appropriate warnings
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate recipe syntax and provide descriptive error messages for invalid configurations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple recipes
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate collapsible markdown sections containing raw diagram source code for traceability
- **FR-011**: System MUST achieve sub-10 second generation time for standard documentation sets
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain >95% accuracy in automatic framework selection
- **FR-013**: System MUST support rendering for at least 10 different diagram types
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to override default framework mapping on a per-diagram basis
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide a summary log with asset folder tree and quick links upon completion
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum recipe file size limit not specified]
- **FR-017**: System MUST retain generated assets for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-018**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent user limit not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Recipe**: YAML configuration file containing diagram specifications, PRD content references, output paths, and processing instructions
- **Diagram Specification**: Framework-specific diagram definition including type, content, and rendering parameters
- **Framework Mapping**: Association between diagram types and optimal rendering frameworks with fallback options
- **Output Asset**: Generated diagram files (SVG, PNG) and markdown documentation with proper embedding and references
- **Processing Log**: Record of recipe execution including success/failure status, warnings, and generated asset locations
