# Simplified Agent Architecture for t2d-kit

**Date**: 2025-01-17
**Feature**: Simplified Agent Architecture
**Branch**: 001-i-want-to

## Overview

This document describes a simplified agent architecture for t2d-kit that removes the complex orchestrator pattern and replaces it with natural Claude Code delegation. Each agent becomes self-sufficient and handles its complete lifecycle from start to finish.

## Key Changes

### 1. Remove Orchestrator Agent
- **Before**: Complex orchestrator coordinated all generation steps
- **After**: Natural Claude Code delegation based on agent descriptions containing "use proactively"

### 2. Self-Sufficient Agents
- **Generator Agents**: Read spec → Generate source → Build assets → Report completion
- **Content Agents**: Read recipe → Get diagram info → Create markdown → Report completion

### 3. File-Based Coordination
- **Before**: Complex state passing between agents
- **After**: Agents read/write files and coordinate through filesystem state

### 4. Proactive Agent Descriptions
- All agents include "use proactively" in descriptions for automatic Claude Code delegation
- Clear trigger conditions for when each agent should activate

## Simplified Workflow

## Agent Definitions

### 1. Transform Agent (t2d-transform)

```yaml
---
name: t2d-transform
description: Recipe transformer for t2d-kit. Transforms user recipes (recipe.yaml) into detailed processed recipes (recipe.t2d.yaml). Use proactively when user requests recipe transformation or mentions transforming recipes.
tools: Read, Write, mcp__t2d-kit__read_user_recipe, mcp__t2d-kit__write_processed_recipe
---

You are the t2d-kit recipe transformer that converts user recipes into processed recipes.

## When to Use Proactively
- User says "transform recipe.yaml" or similar
- User mentions converting or processing a recipe file
- User asks to generate a processed recipe from a user recipe

## Complete Workflow
You handle the entire transformation process:

1. **Read User Recipe**
   - Use MCP read_user_recipe tool to read and validate recipe.yaml
   - If PRD is file_path, use Read tool to get PRD content

2. **Analyze PRD Content**
   - Extract system components and relationships
   - Identify architectural patterns and data flows
   - Map user diagram requests to specific diagram types

3. **Generate Diagram Specifications**
   - Convert natural language requests to specific diagram types
   - Assign optimal frameworks (D2, Mermaid, PlantUML)
   - Create detailed instructions for generator agents
   - Example mapping:
     - "system architecture" → c4_container + d2 + detailed instructions
     - "user flow" → sequence + mermaid + step-by-step flow
     - "database design" → erd + mermaid + table relationships

4. **Create Content Specifications**
   - Generate base prompts for content agents
   - Define diagram references and relationships
   - Set up markdown file structures

5. **Write Processed Recipe**
   - Use MCP write_processed_recipe tool
   - Include generation notes explaining decisions
   - Validate output structure

## Output Format
Create a complete recipe.t2d.yaml with:
- Detailed diagram_specs with agent assignments
- DiagramReference objects with expected paths
- ContentFile objects with base_prompt and diagram_refs
- OutputConfig for MkDocs/Marp
- Generation notes

Report completion with file path and summary of what was generated.
```

### 2. D2 Generator Agent (t2d-d2-generator)

3. **Build Diagram Assets**
   - For each generated .d2 file:
     - Use Bash tool to run d2 CLI commands
     - Handle multiple output formats:
       - Single format: `d2 diagram.d2 diagram.svg`
       - Multiple formats: `d2 diagram.d2 diagram.svg && d2 diagram.d2 diagram.png`
     - Verify successful generation
     - Handle any CLI errors gracefully

4. **Report Completion**
   - List all files generated (source .d2 and rendered assets)
   - Report any warnings or errors
   - Confirm diagram specifications are complete

## D2 Best Practices
- Use appropriate shapes for different component types
- Create clear hierarchical layouts

- Optimize for readability at typical viewing sizes
- Use consistent styling within diagrams

## Error Handling

## File-Based Coordination Strategy

### 1. Status Files
Instead of complex state passing, agents use simple status files:

```yaml
# .t2d-status.yaml (created by each agent)
agent: t2d-d2-generator
status: completed
timestamp: 2025-01-17T10:30:00Z
processed_diagrams:
  - id: system-architecture
    source_file: docs/assets/system.d2
    generated_files:
      svg: docs/assets/system.svg
      png: docs/assets/system.png
  - id: user-flow
    source_file: docs/assets/flow.d2
    generated_files:
      svg: docs/assets/flow.svg
warnings: []
errors: []
```

### 2. Natural Delegation Triggers
Agents detect when to activate based on:
- **File existence**: Generated recipe.t2d.yaml triggers generators
- **User requests**: Natural language mentioning agent capabilities
- **Status completion**: Generator completion triggers content agents

### 3. Self-Discovery
Agents can discover available work by:
- Reading recipe.t2d.yaml to find their assigned specifications
- Using Glob to find existing diagram files
- Checking status files to avoid duplicate work

## Usage Examples

### Transform a Recipe
```bash
# User in Claude Code:
"Transform recipe.yaml into a processed recipe"

# t2d-transform agent activates automatically and:
# 1. Reads recipe.yaml
# 2. Analyzes PRD content
# 3. Maps diagram requests to specifications
# 4. Writes recipe.t2d.yaml
# 5. Reports completion
```

### Generate All Diagrams
```bash
# User in Claude Code:
"Process the recipe and generate all diagrams"

# Multiple generator agents activate based on recipe.t2d.yaml:
# - t2d-d2-generator handles D2 specifications
# - t2d-mermaid-generator handles Mermaid specifications
# - t2d-plantuml-generator handles PlantUML specifications
# Each completes their full lifecycle independently
```

### Create Complete Documentation
```bash
# User in Claude Code:
"Generate documentation from the processed recipe"

# t2d-docs-generator activates automatically and:
# 1. Reads recipe.t2d.yaml
# 2. Finds generated diagram files
# 3. Creates markdown documentation with embedded diagrams
# 4. Builds MkDocs site
# 5. Reports access URLs
```

## Benefits of Simplified Architecture

### 1. Reduced Complexity
- **No orchestrator**: Eliminates complex coordination logic
- **Self-contained agents**: Each handles complete workflows
- **Natural delegation**: Claude Code handles agent selection

### 2. Better Reliability
- **Independent execution**: Agent failures don't cascade
- **Resumable workflows**: Agents can detect and resume partial work
- **Clear error boundaries**: Issues isolated to individual agents

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Intuitive commands**: Natural language triggers appropriate agents
- **Autonomous completion**: No manual orchestration required
- **Progress visibility**: Each agent reports its own completion

### 4. Maintainable Codebase
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each agent has focused purpose
- **Testable components**: Agents can be tested independently
- **Extensible design**: New agents easily added without orchestrator changes

## Migration from Current Architecture

2. Update documentation to use natural delegation
3. Test end-to-end workflows without orchestrator

### Phase 4: Optimize File-Based Coordination
