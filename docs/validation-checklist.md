# T055: Quickstart Validation Scenarios

## Validation Checklist

This document confirms that the quickstart scenarios from `specs/001-i-want-to/quickstart.md` are supported by the implementation.

### ✅ Installation Scenarios

#### 1. Install with uv package manager
- [x] `pyproject.toml` configured for uv/pip installation
- [x] Package structure follows Python standards (`src/` layout)
- [x] Entry points defined for CLI commands

#### 2. Setup intelligent agents
- [x] `t2d setup` command implemented in `src/t2d_kit/cli/setup.py`
- [x] Agents installed to `~/.claude/agents/`
- [x] All 6 agents have proper YAML frontmatter

#### 3. Connect to existing MkDocs site
- [x] MCP server works in current directory
- [x] `t2d mcp .` command implemented
- [x] Claude Desktop config detection

### ✅ Prerequisites

#### 1. Automatic setup with mise
- [x] `.mise.toml` configuration file created
- [x] All required tools defined (Python, Node, Go, Java)
- [x] Tasks for setup and validation

#### 2. Tool verification
- [x] `t2d verify` command implemented
- [x] Checks for all required tools
- [x] Reports missing dependencies

### ✅ Basic Workflow

#### 1. Create a Recipe
- [x] `UserRecipe` model validates YAML structure
- [x] Example recipes in `examples/simple/` and `examples/complex/`
- [x] PRD content support (embedded and file reference)

#### 2. Transform Recipe
- [x] Transform agent with "use proactively" trigger
- [x] MCP tool `read_user_recipe` implemented
- [x] MCP tool `write_processed_recipe` implemented

#### 3. Generate Diagrams
- [x] D2 generator agent ready
- [x] Mermaid generator agent ready
- [x] PlantUML generator agent ready
- [x] Parallel processing supported

#### 4. Create Documentation
- [x] Documentation generator agent ready
- [x] MkDocs page integration (`MkDocsPageConfig`)
- [x] Diagram embedding support

#### 5. Build Presentations
- [x] Slides generator agent ready
- [x] Marp configuration (`MarpConfig`)
- [x] Multiple export formats

### ✅ Agent Architecture

#### 1. Self-organizing agents
- [x] No orchestrator needed
- [x] "use proactively" in all agent descriptions
- [x] Natural language activation patterns

#### 2. File-based coordination
- [x] StateManager with `.t2d-state/` directory
- [x] JSON state files for coordination
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms

#### 3. Parallel execution
- [x] Multiple agents can run simultaneously
- [x] State files prevent conflicts
- [x] Performance tests confirm efficiency

### ✅ Integration Features

#### 1. MCP Server
- [x] FastMCP implementation
- [x] All required tools (read, write, validate, watch)
- [x] Claude Desktop stdio mode support

#### 2. CLI Commands
- [x] `t2d setup` - Install agents
- [x] `t2d mcp` - Start MCP server
- [x] `t2d verify` - Check installation

#### 3. Error Handling
- [x] Validation with Pydantic models
- [x] Graceful failure in agents
- [x] State recovery with backups

### ✅ Performance Requirements

#### 1. Recipe validation
- [x] Performance test for <200ms validation
- [x] Test files in `tests/performance/test_processing.py`

#### 2. Large recipe support
- [x] Tests for 10+ diagrams
- [x] Memory efficiency tests
- [x] Parallel processing tests

#### 3. State management
- [x] Cache performance tests
- [x] Concurrent access tests
- [x] Cleanup mechanisms
